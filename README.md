# 🍬 **Candy Crush Game** 🍬

## 📝 **Overview**
This is a console-based implementation of the popular **Candy Crush** game. The game allows users to interact with a grid of "candies" represented by symbols. Players can swap candies to form horizontal or vertical lines of three matching candies, which will then burst, earning points. The goal of the game is to reach a targeted score within a set number of moves.

## 🎮 **Features**
- **🍬 Random Candy Generation**: The game grid is populated with different candies represented by symbols (e.g., '#', '$', '@', '?', '!').
- **💥 Candy Matching**: Players can match three or more adjacent candies horizontally or vertically to burst them and gain points.
- **🕹️ Movement Controls**: Players can move the cursor around the grid using arrow keys and swap adjacent candies by pressing the spacebar.
- **🏆 Score Tracking**: The player's score is updated as candies burst. The player needs to reach a predefined target score within a set number of moves to win the game.
- **📖 Game Instructions**: Instructions on how to play the game are available through the main menu.
